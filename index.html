<h2>RESUME - Web Development Contractor </h2>

<h3>SUMMARY</h3> 

<p>I am a trained Building Construction Engineer with an alternative, but particular interest plus skillset in developing  Web Technology to function as information media and additionally to serve as business bridges between supply and demand or producers and consumers that are physically apart from each other.</p> 

<p>Though Web Development is not my primary area of education, I have come to realize that the actual creators and developers web-based platforms and applications are those who wield the most powerful softpower arsenal of the global village.  Thanks to web apps and web media platforms, saavy end-users currently have very great global influence/bearing on culture, business economy, security, organizations, politics and populations. This is the principal reason web-dev is the single most powerful influence tool and marketing means of today and tomorrow.</p>   

<p>It is this data-grounded truth that drew my interest to the web-development space. With a background in erecting physical Buildings, I bring a sharply critical mindframe to Web Development to help businesses and individuals imagine, develop and publish complex apps and simple ideas online. I'm into web-dev not to only build informative websites, but to build interactive web applications capable of shortening lengthy business tasks by introducing new ways of doing many old or traditional activities on the web.
